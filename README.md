A classic tic tac toe game involves two players and a board with nine spaces. Each player will take turns filling a space with their token. At the start of the game, each player selects a token of their choice which will represent their selected board spaces. In order to win a game, a player has to gain three board spaces in a row. The row can be horizonal, vertical, or diagonal. If the board fills up before a player gains three spaces, the game will result in a draw.
